# üìß Email Parser for Vikunja

This script connects to your email inbox and automatically creates tasks in [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io) based on incoming emails.

- üíå Reads unread emails via IMAP
- üì¨ Parses the subject line to determine the target Vikunja project
- ‚úçÔ∏è Creates a new task with the email body as the task description
- üìé Supports file attachments (uploaded to the created task)
- üê≥ Runs as a Docker container with cron (using Supercronic)
- üê≥ Can be run as a job Docker container

---

## üöÄ How It Works

The script scans your inbox for **unread emails**, checks if the subject matches any keyword in `PROJECT_MAPPING`, and creates a task in the matching Vikunja project.

For example, with this config:

```env
PROJECT_MAPPING='{"support": "3", "dev": "7"}'
```

- An email with subject: `Bug report - support` ‚Üí creates a task in project ID **3**
- An email with subject: `dev: add feature X` ‚Üí creates a task in project ID **7**

The matching keyword (`support`, `dev`) is **removed** from the task title.

## üê≥ Running in Docker

### With Cron (default):

```bash
docker run -d   --name vikunja-mail-parser   -e IMAP_SERVER=imap.example.com   -e EMAIL_ACCOUNT=you@example.com   -e EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourpassword   -e VIKUNJA_API_URL=https://vikunja.example.com/api/v1   -e VIKUNJA_TOKEN=your-vikunja-token   -e PROJECT_MAPPING='{"support": "3", "dev": "7"}'   -e IMAP_FOLDER='inbox'   --restart unless-stopped   weselinka/vikunja-mail-parser
```

### Without Cron (Oneshot):

There also is a container `weselinka/vikunja-mail-parser:oneshot` that runs the script just once, without using cron.

To run the oneshot version of the container:

```bash
docker run --rm   -e IMAP_SERVER=imap.example.com   -e EMAIL_ACCOUNT=you@example.com   -e EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourpassword   -e VIKUNJA_API_URL=https://vikunja.example.com/api/v1   -e VIKUNJA_TOKEN=your-vikunja-token   -e PROJECT_MAPPING='{"support": "3", "dev": "7"}'   -e IMAP_FOLDER='inbox'   weselinka/vikunja-mail-parser:oneshot
```

This will execute the script once and exit, without scheduling future runs.

## üõ† Build the Docker Image Locally

Download the project and inside the project directory run:
```bash
docker build -t weselinka/vikunja-mail-parser:latest .
```

## üí° Notes

- Emails must be **unread** to be processed.
- Attachments will be uploaded to the created task.
- Tasks are created with the full email body (formatted with line breaks or HTML).
- If no keyword in the subject matches `PROJECT_MAPPING`, the email is **MARKED READ** and ignored.
